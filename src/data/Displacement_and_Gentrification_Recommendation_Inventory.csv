• Allow lower parking requirements for ADUs, especially in older neighborhoods built before parking requirements were imposed. Do not impose additional parking requirements for the primary dwelling unit if they do currently exist and were not required at the time of development.
• Waive impact fees for developed affordable units, beyond S.M.A.R.T Housing units, up to an annual maximum subsidy.
